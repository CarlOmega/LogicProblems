;The program loops through n times for each digit n, in a student number printing that number on 
;a line n times then loops to next line. if the number is 0 it skips a line

;"value" is used to compare the number of times printed
;"digPos" is to see what digit it is upto  
;"dig1" is the first digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"dig2" is the second digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"dig3" is the third digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"dig4" is the fourth digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"dig5" is the fith digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"dig6" is the sixth digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"dig7" is the seventh digit in the student number stored in HEX/ASCII
;"pos" is the location of the start of the line that its upto stored in a word

;it will store the output into the display buffer at FB00-FF37
